#summary Project TODO list

== Not yet implemented ==

  * Image support
  * 'description/coverpage' element support
  * 'description/annotation' element support
  * PHP frontend
  * multiple 'author' elements in 'title-info'

== Buggy ==

  * Epigraphs does not always look good, especially if they do not fit page. Try alternative  epigraph packeages mentioned [http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=epigraph here]
  * Using 'hyperref' to enable links from TOC to sections causing pdfopt crash.
